/*  Fibonacci sequence is the series of numbers
	0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,...
	The first two numbers in this series are 0 and 1
	The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it
	By adding the first two numbers i.e. 0 and 1, we get the third number i.e. 2 and so on...

//  To find nth term of Fibonacci series using Recursion:
#include<stdio.h>
int fibonacci(int num)
{
	if(num==1)
	return 0;
	if(num==2)
	return 1;
	else
	return fibonacci(num-1)+fibonacci(num-2);

	int n;
	printf("Enter the value of n:\n");
	scanf("%d",&n);
	printf("nth Fibonacci term is:\n", );

/* OUTPUT:
Enter the value of n:
8
8th Fibonacci term is:
13
